# Predicting mutation rate variations with DNA shape

## Introduction

This is the GitHub repository for the Liu Z and Samee MAH 2021 publication, Mutation rate variations in the human genome are encoded in DNA shape. The manuscript is currently under review and is submitted to bioRxiv (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.15.426837); see the bottom of the page for citation information.

This repo contains the main notebook for our publication, as well as other codes and snippets used for generating our final results. 

## What are the input data?

For the mutation rates data, please request Dr. Benjamin F. Voight; their data is also available from Dr. Voight's GitHub (https://github.com/bvoight/mutvar_fwdRegr). We would **strongly encourage** you to first communicate with and request access from Dr. Voight and cite their study in the case you want to use their data. 

As you might have noticed, we included an input mutation rate data file in our example script directory. We would **strongly discourage** you to directly use this data for other purposes. This input data is generated by one of our in-production pipelines, and then re-formatted to match the format of the Aggarwala and Voight data. It is intended to be a toy dataset and we do not currently have documentation for how to generate it. If you are interested, please stay tuned as we do have plans to release our pipeline to the Samee Lab GitHub, or contact us and we are more than happy to pass the data (as well as the steps to generate it) to you.

For the *DNAshape* reference table, we have included a 7-mer reference table in the "data_input" directory. However, we strongly encourage you to also check out Zian Liu's repo (https://github.com/ZnL-BCM/DNAshapeR_reference) which contains scripts for extracting the reference table from the *DNAshapeR* package. Please make sure to cite the four *DNAshapeR* papers when using this excel spreadsheet. 

For the *DNAshapeR* package, please visit Tsu-Pei Chiu's GitHub page (http://tsupeichiu.github.io/DNAshapeR/) for more information.

## How can I run this for myself?

We have included our main Jupyter notebook ("Publication_note.ipynb") in this repo. However, since it is very messy, we encourage using it mostly as a reference document. Instead, we have separately prepared an example pipeline in the "pipeline_example" directory. 

To run our model, simply call:

``python main.py input_mutation_file reference_dnashape_file.xlsx``

from the example directory. The included README file will share more regarding what to do, and the script file is well annotated for you to follow.
